Employee Management System
Description and Usage
Employee Management System with CRUD capabilities using mySQL and command-line application (minus the D for Delete). Currently can view all employees( name, manager id, title, salary and dept), or view employees by Department or Role selected by user via command-line app. Can also add a new employee to the system. Ran into trouble with updating existing employee role, however my tutor was able to help me resolve the error I encountered by creating a questions array and passing that through the prompt function.
